Hello, I'm Junmo Lee. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://ise.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/), 
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jeongyoun Ahn](https://statds.kaist.ac.kr/professor).

My doctoral research focuses on the following areas from a statistical perspective:
- Multimodal Learning
- Transfer Learning
- Generative Models

Previously, I worked on problems such as change point detection and fake news detection.
